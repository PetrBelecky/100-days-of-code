## Log

### Day 16 (2019-28-01)
Refresher and practice for JavaScript if/else statements and some ES6 arrow functions, also [practiced a DOM manipulation](https://github.com/PetrBelecky/bootcamp-excercises/tree/master/day-12-javascript).  

### Day 15 (2019-27-01)
Refreshed [JavaScript basics](https://github.com/PetrBelecky/bootcamp-excercises/tree/master/day-11-javascript/js-exercise) and practiced logic with some puzzles.

### Day 14 (2019-26-01) 
Took an easy day to regenerate a bit and watched some videos from [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) and [Andy Sterkowitz](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ9qFEC82qM6Pk-54Q4TVWA). 

### Day 13 (2019-25-01)
Done a little bit of form styling on my portfolio page (btw I hate you, textarea).

### Day 12 (2019-24-01)
Goal was to make a website in a day. Haven't finished it completely, but done some great teamwork and practiced a git workflow. 

### Day 11 (2019-23-01)
Practiced git teamwork with branching and pulling, and worked on my [portfolio](https://github.com/PetrBelecky/portfolio).

### Day 10 (2019-22-01)
I was introduced to a [BEM notation](http://getbem.com/introduction/) and I am immediately loving it. Done some [simple pages](https://github.com/PetrBelecky/bootcamp-excercises/tree/master/day-08-html-css) using BEM. 

### Day 9 (2019-21-01)
For the first time got my hands on media-queries and tried the mobile-first mindset. Also worked on some HTML forms.  

### Day 8 (2019-20-01)
I started working with a Sass and was introduced to Gulp. Done a [simple page](https://github.com/PetrBelecky/bootcamp-excercises/tree/master/day-06-css/sass-excercise) with a lot of flexbox and styling. Learned about adding icons to HTML. 

### Day 7 (2019-19-01)
Took an easy day with some [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/p/flexbox-zombies) killing and then listened to awesome-teachers David Malan & Colt Steele on [CodeNewbie Podcasts](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast). Key takeaway: 

"You don't have to understand everything at once. Learning takes time."

### Day 6 (2019-18-01)
I have spent the whole day with a flexbox and I am starting to feel comfortable working with it. Big shout-out to CSS games [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/), [Flexbox Defense](http://www.flexboxdefense.com/) a [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/p/flexbox-zombies)! It helped me a lot! 

Also started to work on my [portfolio website](https://github.com/PetrBelecky/portfolio) - flexbox in practice! 

### Day 5 (2019-17-01)
For the first time spent significant time with the flexbox. The amount of information has scared me at first, but after a while started to seem very comprehensible. Have done [two simple layouts](https://github.com/PetrBelecky/bootcamp-excercises/tree/master/day-05-css) to get familiar with the flexbox.    

### Day 4 (2019-16-01)
I tried to wrap my head around [basic positioning](https://github.com/PetrBelecky/bootcamp-excercises/tree/master/day-04-html-css) with static, relative, absolute & fixed properties. Created a [simple webpage](https://github.com/piedaddy/Kindergarten) from a scratch, using basic positioning and creativity with selectors.  

### Day 3 (2019-15-01)
Started the day with [logical puzzles](https://brilliant.org/daily-problems/), continued with a practice of CSS selectors and CSS specificity rules.

### Day 2 (2019-14-01)
Solved some logical puzzles, practiced basic HTML/CSS and committed myself to Git (pun intended).

### Day 1 (2019-13-01)
Refreshing basics of a product development process, personas, user workflow, UX/UI, wireframes, images, favicons and HTML semantics.
