## Log

### Day 6
I have spent the whole day with a flexbox and I am starting to feel comfortable working with it. Big shout-out to CSS games [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/), [Flexbox Defense](http://www.flexboxdefense.com/) a [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/p/flexbox-zombies)! It helped me a lot! 

Also started to work on my [portfolio website](https://github.com/PetrBelecky/portfolio) - flexbox in practice! 

### Day 5
For the first time spent significant time with the flexbox. The amount of information has scared me at first, but after a while started to seem very comprehensible. Have done [two simple layouts](https://github.com/PetrBelecky/bootcamp-excercises/tree/master/day-05-css) to get familiar with the flexbox.    

### Day 4
I tried to wrap my head around [basic positioning](https://github.com/PetrBelecky/bootcamp-excercises/tree/master/day-04-html-css) with static, relative, absolute & fixed properties. Created a [simple webpage](https://github.com/piedaddy/Kindergarten) from a scratch, using basic positioning and creativity with selectors.  

### Day 3
Started the day with [logical puzzles](https://brilliant.org/daily-problems/), continued with a practice of CSS selectors and CSS specificity rules. 

ðŸ’¡Did you know Specifishity? If not, you should definitely [check it out](https://specifishity.com/)! Also shoutout for amazing [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/)!


### Day 2
Solved some logical puzzles, practiced basic HTML/CSS and committed myself to Git (pun intended).

### Day 1
Refreshing basics of a product development process, personas, user workflow, UX/UI, wireframes, images, favicons and HTML semantics.

ðŸ’¡Did you know: Human-centered design has its official standard? It is ISO 9241-210!
